    <h3>Introduction to Dance Music Evolution</h3>
    <p>Few musical genres have evolved so dramatically in the 20th and 21st century than <b><i>Dance Music…</i></b><br><br>Other genres have not changed much over time, possibly except for Jazz. Musical styles that have existed for a long time like Classical, Rock or Pop, have remained close to their origins. Classical music has been based on musicians in large orchestra’s playing classical instruments like violins, cellos, and horns for centuries without much evolution. Rock and Pop keep vocals, drums, pianos and especially guitars at the heart of their style – largely unchanged for more than 60 years. Jazz, however, has evolved as time progressed – possibly unsurprising as the genre is built on improvisation, exploring new musical possibilities, and playing something different every time, creating “on-the-fly”. Therefore, Jazz played in the sixties sounds quite different as what the descendant of these artists play in current days, although still largely based on playing wind- and rhythm instruments. And yet, Dance Music has changed and diversified over time even more than Jazz. The picture below is a fun creative impression of how sub genres within Dance and underlying styles have been born, have evolved, and have influenced and inspired one another over time.

    This website explores the evolution of Dance Music from the 70’s of the last century until the first period of the 21st century. Note that I have not put much commercially successful music on the site, but instead have tried to focus more on lesser known and often more “underground”-type tracks. I feel these tracks have done a lot more for the evolution of the music than much commercially produced music. Nevertheless, many of the examples have started small but grown famous, thereby driving evolution. Also please note that I have in no way tried to be complete or even totally correct: this site is simply an online expression of a hobby, created as a web design project. There is "scientific" type research involved. Other people can have a different opinion or recollection, of course – I have merely described something from my own experience and memory, as an avid music fan.<br><br>
    Lastly please note that, although I “own” all music on this site in some way (meaning I have bought everything as vinyl, CD, stream, or audio file at some point, therefore licenced), I do no own any of the copyrights to any of the music, videos or other visuals presented here. Copyrights are owned by the original artists and composers – if you like the tracks, find the artists on a streaming service like f.i. Spotify or Tidal or on YouTube and show appreciation for what they have created.
