    <h3>New Sounds, New Phenomena</h3>
    <p>Technological possibilities kept expanding in the nineties and new genres, subgenres and sub-subgenres kept emerging. Noteworthy ones that remain relevant today are <b>Rave</b>, <b>Drum & Bass</b>, and <b>Trance</b>. <br><br>Some feel that the directions that some dance music was taking led to flattening of compositions and creation of empty tracks with little content or meaning and requiring little compositional effort or inspiration. The use of long, unprocessed, and easily recognisable samples from other artists’ hit songs as main feature of a new track, sometimes only adding a beat mixed in from a drum machine, became an accepted, mainstream, and commercially successful practice.<br><br>Yet, despite the criticism, the new music inspired new youth sub-cultures in societies. Rave- and House parties, attracting thousands of people and sometimes lasting for days, became a new phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p class="textleft">
    Club culture in big cities like Berlin, London and New York was thriving and inspired many other places. Dance parties with DJ’s around pools in sunny holiday destinations like Ibiza or the Spanish costa’s – or apres-ski fests in Austria and Switzerland in winter, became widely known and very popular.

    <h3>The DJ's</h3>
    <p>In the seventies, people playing dance music in bars and clubs and hosting a great night out for the audience were coined disk jockey’s, or DJ’s. They originally played disco and other dance tracks from vinyl records, focusing mainly on mixing tracks non-stop to keep the audience dancing. As time progressed in the late eighties, DJ’s increasingly started producing “artful” expressions of their own by creating variations to the records they played (“remixing”) or adding or changing sounds by creative use of the turntables and other technology they used. Technology companies started designing specialist turntables, sampler machines, mixing panels and other sound equipment to support this.
    </p>
    <p>This development really took off in the nineties. Many DJ’s started creating a musical style of their own, began composing dance tracks and other original music in collaboration with other musicians or even under their own “brand” name. Over time, DJ’s really became original musical artists themselves.<br><br>In 1994, DJ Babu coined the term “Turntablism” to indicate the phenomenon where DJ’s started manipulating sounds from records, and therefore created something new. It described the difference between a DJ who simply plays music and one who performs by manipulating the records and mixer to shape the sound. To underscore this development, an important element of DJ’s gear, the since then legendary Technics SL-1200-MK-series turntable series, was branded as the most influential new musical instrument of the 20th century by “Rolling Stone” magazine.

    <br><br>  
    Famous DJ’s like David Guetta, Tiesto and Carl Cox already started playing records during the eighties but became original artists creating their own original tracks in the nineties. Armin van Buuren and Armand van Helden started mid-nineties. Calvin Harris and Steve Aoki late in the nineties. Some of them are among the biggest names in music in the nineties and the 21st century.
