    <h3>Digitalisation</h3>
    <p>Digitalisation is the key theme to change in society and music is no exception. Laptops become available with faster processors and better soundcards, along with audio processing software like Ableton, Cakewalk, Cubase, ProTools and Garageband. The newest mixing panels and Traktor controllers paired with Pioneer’s CDJ equipment make vinyl records obsolete and software takes over beat matching. The art of DJ-ing becomes much easier and music can be produced much more efficiently. And with Auto-Tune, anyone can sing! 
    </p>
    <p>
    What is more, the newest gear is available at affordable prices! Where in the past music production required expensive equipment, found only in designated music studio’s, nowadays almost all equipment can be bought by almost anyone from a music store or even a general electronics store, also at lower budgets. The core of Garageband software is even completely free to use on all Apple devices. In addition, possibilities for distribution and promotion of new music over the internet nowadays provide an immediate and global reach, essentially for free.  
    </p>
    <p>When anyone can easily produce, distribute, and promote music, risk is that music becomes a bit more “disposable” and DJ-ing no longer requires a lot of special skills. But in reality, it appears that “real” musicians distinguish themselves by creating sounds that continuously please audiences - and skilled DJ’s set themselves apart by creatively mixing, adding sounds or making variations, essentially creating great music “on the fly”.
    </p>
    <p>Unsurprisingly, EDM (Electronic Dance Music) as a genre explodes in the 21st century - although it is not always acknowledged as such by everyone. Some do not see it as separate genre, or even as something altogether “new”. Especially in the 21st century, new genres and subgenres seem to come and go - like f.i. Minimal, Dubstep, Electroclash.</p>
    <p class="textright">
    They combine influences from everywhere and make something new. But lines between genres become increasingly blurred and much dance music seems to become more generic. Nevertheless, EDM as an expression or genre - although started in the nineties in Europe - becomes extremely popular from 2011 in the US as well, with acts like Skrillex and Swedish House Maffia.

    <h3>DJ Collaborations</h3>
    <p>In the meantime DJ’s have become real stars. Live DJ show become elaborate light- and entertainment shows, with overwhelming visuals and live dance and theatre shows to accompany the music. This compensates for the often not remarkably interesting visual of a DJ working his electronics for a few hours. In 2003, DJ Tiesto kicked off this new form of music show by playing the first ever 8-hour long DJ-only show in the Netherlands. Since then, DJ’s like Hardwell, Avici, Armin van Buuren, and Calvin Harris have followed suit. Especially Steve Aoki has gained a reputation of putting on highly interactive show with the audience.
    </p>
    <p>In the 21st century, musical collaborations between artists become very successful and therefore very popular to produce. An executive from a music label is famous for stating in an interview that “…mr. Featuring is the most successful artist of the century…”. Dance music is no exception. In 2009 for the first time, David Guetta collaborates with Kelly Rowland producing a massive hit “When Love Takes Over”. Many collaborations by many DJ’s follow.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the midst of an avalanche of electronic dance music in this century, it is interesting to see that there are artists that score huge successes with dance music that directly descends from Disco music of the seventies. In 2013, Daft Punk and Pharell Williams, together with seventies hero Nile Rogers, score a massive global hit with “Get Lucky’. The song is part of a Daft Punk album, “Random Access Memories”, which theme is to honour dance music and artists of the seventies.
    </p>
    <p class="textleft">
    In 2020, Dua Lipa releases one of the most successful albums of the decade with “Future Nostalgia, also inspired by seventies and eighties dance music. And Canadian artist The Weeknd released “After Hours” in 2020, reliving the eighties in many of the tracks.<br><Br>In relation to other music styles, dance music has especially changed and progressed in many different directions over time. But some dance music seems to have such a profound effect on people that is stays exactly as it was 50 years ago!
