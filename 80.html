    <h3>US : House and Techno</h3>
    <p>In the eighties, dance music truly came together with electronic music. Technology and electronic equipment were routinely used in the production of dance music, which resulted in an explosion of different dance music styles around the world. Use of the term “Disco” became very unpopular at the end of the seventies because, sadly, the music style received a lot of hate - mainly from traditional musicians in rock, jazz, or pop. Nevertheless, much of eighties dance music is a clear progression of seventies Disco, just called by a lot of different names.
    </p>
    <p>
    Developments of dance music in Europe and the United States were quite different. Of the dance music genres that originated in the eighties in the US, <b>House</b> (from Chicago) and <b>Techno</b> (from Detroit) are the ones that stood the test of time and still survive in some form today. Both became musical styles with a global reach. In the years that followed, however, Techno became much more popular in Europe than in the US and is since then seen as more of a European phenomenon. The arrival of “EDM” (Electronic Dance Music) in Europe, which blew over to the US at the end of the nineties and early 00’s, essentially meant a revival of Techno in the US as well.
    </p>
    <p class="textright">
    Also based in dance music, <b>Rap</b> and <b>Hip-Hop</b> style originated in New York in the late seventies and early eighties. Although generally built on an electronic beat, and therefore rooted in Dance music, Rap and Hip-Hop focused on inventive and creative use of lyrics, rhythms, and rhymes as well as a radical new style of vocals. This new style grew immense popular all over the world and essentially became a whole new musical genre of its own, next to Dance music. Nevertheless, it remains closely related.

    <h3>Europe : Italo and Eurobeat</h3>
    <p>In the meantime in Europe, dance music genres like <b>Italo Disco</b> and <b>Hi-NRG/Eurobeat</b> were developed using the newest electronic gadgets, and they started dominated dance floors in Germany, France, Italy, The Netherlands, and Belgium. Many vocals were in English, but also music with vocals in local languages was produced. Voices and lyrics did not always prove to be most successful feature of the tracks and some of the most successful dance music of that time, especially in clubs, were instrumental tracks. Acts like Koto, Cyber People or Cellophane focused instead on driving rhythms, pumping bass lines and catchy melodic riffs.<br><br>The legendary label ZYX records from Germany was an important driving force in the success of Italo Disco, Hi-NRG and other dance related genres, contracting artists from Italy, France, Germany and The Netherlands and publishing their music internationally. Especially Hi-NRG and Eurodance genres caught on outside Europe as well – for instance Canadian act Lime was once of the biggest dance acts of the eighties, in clubs and charts alike.

    <p class="textleft">
    In Europe and the UK, many traditional bands embraced electronics and became crossover bands, adopting a new sound driven by synthesizers and drum machines. One of the major forces is New Order from Manchester in the UK. Reincarnated from rock/wave 70's band Joy Division, they remain an influential electronics band untill today. Their landmark track "Blue Monday/The Beach" from 1983 inspired EDM many years after.
